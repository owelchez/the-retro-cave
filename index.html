      My name is Adam and I'm 36 years old and the owner / operator of The Retro Game Cave.  Growing up in a household with 3 older brothers, I am the poster child of everything 80's.  I want my generation as well as the next to continue to enjoy, cherish, collect, and play video games.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Retro Game Cave is not just another game store.  Our roots run deep with a strong knowledge of retro gaming and a passion that can't be found anywhere else.  My space is only 400 sq. feet, but love for gaming is bigger than any other competitor!  At The Retro Game Cave you'll receive a one on one intimate shopping / selling experience, as well as, a retro video game inventory that big game stores which I won't mention can't match.

Also Wii, PS3, Xbox 360, DS, 3DS.  Thank you in advance and hope to hear from you soon!
